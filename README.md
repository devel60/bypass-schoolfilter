bypass lightspeed with dns. this is for my school, but may work for others

the school wont be able to do anything about it, as nothing is done on the school device besides connect to a hotspot

i am absolutely not responsible if you get in trouble for this

pls read everything to minimize the risk

# instructions (incomplete but should be good enough)
## on android:
go to settings > connections > more connection settings or search for DNS
set private dns to devel60.duckdns.org
make your hotspot never turn off when you turn it on
make your hotspot a private network so teachers dont see it
turn on hotspot when you get to school and put it in your bag/binder or wherever teachers dont see but you can carry it around
connect to hotspot by manually putting in its name and password
some websites will give an error, ignore it

## on ios:
wip, not possible at this moment due to not having global dns settings

## on the chromebook:
go to the hosts file here and see what websites you want to go to, then see the domain attached to it. for example, discord is nytimes.com

when you go to a link for a website, make sure to replace the url with the unblocked one. for example, gist.github.com will instead be gist.github.com

# notes
you must disconnect from the hotspot and reconnect to the school wifi if you want to access educational sites because most will be redirected to unblock sites

you probably should stay connected to the school wifi if you know the teacher is on some monitoring software like hapara, otherwise theyll see youre offline and get suspicious
