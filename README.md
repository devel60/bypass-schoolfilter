bypass lightspeed with dns. this is for my school, but may work for others
the school wont be able to do anything about it, as nothing is done on the school device besides connect to a hotspot
i am absolutely not responsible if you get in trouble for this

# instructions (incomplete but should be good enough)
## on android:
go to settings > connections > more connection settings or search for DNS
set private dns to devel60.duckdns.org
make your hotspot never turn off when you turn it on
make your hotspot a private network so teachers dont see it
turn on hotspot when you get to school and put it in your bag/binder or wherever teachers dont see but you can carry it around
connect to hotspot by manually putting in its name and password
some websites will give an error, ignore it

## on ios:
wip, not possible at this moment due to not having global dns settings
